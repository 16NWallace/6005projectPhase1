/** GENERAL TESTING STRATEGY FOR GADGETS
 * 
 * --Constructors--
 * For each type of Gadget: 
 * Catch error when coordinate passed into constructor is outside of the 20x20 board
 * Catch error when coordinate passed into constructor is contained in the board, but one of the remaining corners is outside
 * Construct without trigger/action connection
 * Construct with trigger/action connections
 * 
 * --Collision Handling--
 * Collide with corner - SquareBumper, TriangleBumper
 * Collide with edge - SquareBumper, TrangleBumper
 * Collide with CircleBumper
 * Ball is moving parallel to object and never collides
 * Collides with Flipper in initial position (both L and R flippers)
 * Collides with Flipper in rotated position (both L and R flippers)
 * Collides with Absorber when no ball is stored
 * Collides with Absorber when ball is stored
 * 
 * --Trigger/Action--
 * initialize without trigger, initialize with one trigger, initialize with multiple triggers
 * Catch error if an object with no action is connected to a trigger (SquareBumper, CircleBumper, TriangleBumper, OuterWall)
 * Check that respondToTrigger() does not mutate anything for gadgets with no action
 * Absorber: not self-triggered
 * Absorber: self-triggered
 * 
 * --ToString--
 * SquareBumper == "#"
 * CircleBumper == "0"
 * TriangleBumper at 0 or 180 == "/"
 * TriangleBumper at 90 or 270 == "\"
 * Absorber == width x height grid of "="
 * OuterWall == . 
 * Flipper vertical == "|"
 * Flipper horizontal == "-"
 * Test for flipper in original state
 * Test for flipper in rotated state
